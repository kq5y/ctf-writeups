using linux in front of class mates
teacher says “Ok students, now open photoshop”
start furiously typing away at terminal to install Wine
Errors out the BtSCTF{we_have_to_censor_that_one
Everyone else has already started their classwork
I start to sweat
Install GIMP
”Umm...what the _and_another_one” a girl next to me asks
I tell her its GIMP and can do everything that photoshop does and IT’S FREE! “Ok class, now use the shape to to draw a circle!” the teacher says
I _and_finally_that_one} break down and cry and run out of the class
I get beat up in the parking lot after school
